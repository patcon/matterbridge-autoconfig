# Matterbridge Auto-Config

App that generates a Matterbridge config file based on channel names.

Right now it's just a CLI script, but will be a web app eventually.

## Features

- Supports: Slack
- Creates translation gateways based on language-code suffix

## :computer: Local Development

### Setup

We recommend using [`pipenv`][pipenv] and [`pyenv`][pyenv] to manage
development environments.

```
pipenv install
cp sample.env .env
# Add your Slack API token here:
vim .env
```

### Running

On the command line:

```
pipenv run python cli.py
```

Or, for the web app:

```
pipenv run python app.py
```

## Configuration

Configuration is done via environment variables. See
[`sample.env`](sample.env) for
details. If a `.env` file is present, its values will be used
automatically.

### `SLACK_API_TOKEN` (Required)

The API token from your Slack team.

You may use [**legacy user tokens**][legacy-tokens] or [**bot
tokens**][bot-tokens]. We recommend bot tokens, or otherwise the token
will have access to all the user's private conversations. Also, a bot
must be invited into each channel or conversation, which is added
precaution in case your token gets released into the wild.

### `TEMPLATE_URL` (Optional)

The URL of a template file that will wrap the auto-generated portion of
your configuration. The string `{{AUTOGENERATED}}` will be replaced.

See
[`examples/matterbridge.sample.toml`](examples/matterbridge.sample.toml).

## Deployment

We host a [version of this on Heroku][demo]. Here are the details:

- `master` branch is automatically deployed there.
- All changes are made throgh pull requests.

## Future Plans

- [x] Serve as a flask webapp
- [x] Use template via base64 envvar or url
- [ ] Configure tokens via envvar (upstream in Matterbridge)
- [ ] Listen for channel updates and regenerate config
- [ ] POST to Matterbridge endpoint to trigger reload (upstream in
  Matterbridge)
